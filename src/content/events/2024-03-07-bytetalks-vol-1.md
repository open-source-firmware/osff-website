In the first edition of OSFF ByteTalks, Subrata Banik (Google) and Vincent Zimmer (Intel) will join us. The topic of the session is: "**FSP Customization - Remove non-mandatory components in the Intel FSP**".

In the realm of open-source firmware, creating a custom Firmware Support Package (FSP) binary is a pivotal step for developers aiming to enhance hardware compatibility and performance. The process involves understanding the hardware's initialization requirements, integrating coreboot or similar open-source firmware solutions, and customizing the FSP to meet specific system needs. Our guests Subrata and Vincent will talk about the process on customizing the Intel FSP and removing non-mandatory components.
