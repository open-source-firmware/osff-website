Like the previous years, the Open Source Firmware Foundation will kick off the year at FOSDEM. You can find us at the coreboot booth in the K building on level 2. Whether you want to chat with us or just get some stickers, we welcome everyone.

FOSDEM is a totally free event for Free and Open Source developers from around the world to meet. Since 2000, FOSDEM has been organized every year.

Happy Hacking and see you in Brussels.
