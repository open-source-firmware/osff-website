*Have you ever heard of the term "BIOS“ or “firmware”? Have you ever wondered what it is about and why it often is a surface of attacks in the past? Why is everybody talking about open source nowadays and how is this connected to the PC or laptop you are owning and using all day long? If you are curious to learn the real truth behind modern firmware, we invite you to go down the rabbit hole with us, really deep down. You will see what modern firmware looks like and where the pitfalls and possible backdoors are on a device you put all your private data on.*

*You will see why security in firmware matters and how open source firmware gives you back the control of the device you own and trust. You will understand which components are there and pretend they are just booting up your system, and what the are capable to do beside their original task.*

The OSFF is hosting a weekend long open source firmware hackathon this November in Germany together with the support from 9elements (thanks again!), Bochum Cube5 and Siemens. The event is aimed for firmware developers and enthusiasts, from beginners to professionals, everyone is welcome!

We will provide drinks and snacks all weekend long so that you can hack *all-day, all-night* on your open-source firmware projects of choice.
