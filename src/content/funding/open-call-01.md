The Open-Source Firmware Foundation is calling for small-scale, high-impact proposals that help grow and strengthen the open-source firmware ecosystem.

We’re looking to support contributions that improve transparency, auditability, security, interoperability, and sustainability in firmware. Whether you're developing new features, improving tooling, writing documentation, or researching real-world issues—if your work supports the open-source firmware space, we want to hear from you.

This call is not tied to pre-allocated funding, but we aim to fund selected proposals in the range of 1,000 EUR to 5,000 EUR.

## What We're Looking For

We encourage proposals that focus on (but are not limited to):

- Development work on core firmware projects
- Enhancements to testing frameworks, tooling, or CI/CD pipelines
- Security and compliance (e.g., SBOM, reproducibility, Secure Boot)
- Developer experience, documentation, or onboarding improvements
- Practical research with implementation outcomes
