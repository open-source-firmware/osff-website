  - We are currently working on developing a Feature Request and Implementation Process that aims to provide a structured workflow for managing feature requests in open-source projects. This process will ensure smoother collaboration between businesses and community developers while maintaining the flexibility of open-source development.

  - The goal is to create a process that minimizes fragmentation, allowing businesses to request and implement features in a way that benefits both them and the open-source community. If you want to get involved in this effort, reach out to Werner Zeh.
